### Architecture

The app is designed with modularity and clean separation of concerns in mind:

   - `ChapterListRepository`: Manages loading, caching, and organizing chapter data.
   - `ChapterDataStore Protocol`: Defines the interface for data fetching.
   - `ChapterLoaderAdapter`: Handles remote data loading and parsing using `SwiftSoup`.

#### 2. **UI Layer**
   - Built entirely with **SwiftUI**.
   - Includes reusable custom components like `DynamicSection` and `HapticButton`.

#### 3. **Persistence**
   - **SwiftData**: Used to persist chapters and maintain state across app sessions.
