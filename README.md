A fan-made companion app for the [DragonBall Multiverse](https://www.dragonball-multiverse.com) website. 

I created this app independently, with permission from the creators of DragonBall Multiverse, to enhance your experience with the webcomic. The app is not affiliated with or developed by the official DragonBall Multiverse team.

## Developer Overview

This section is for developers interested in the technical details of the project.

### Features

- **Cached Chapters:** Users can view and manage cached chapters locally on their device.
- **Special Universe Sections:** Explore chapters grouped by their universe.
- **Web Links:** Direct access to DragonBall Multiverse webcomic pages.
- **Error Handling:** Alerts for cache clearing or data loading issues.

### Architecture

The app is designed with modularity and clean separation of concerns in mind:

- **MVVM Architecture:** Combines `View`, `ViewModel`, and `Model` layers for scalable and testable code.
- **SwiftData Integration:** Simplifies data persistence and management.
- **Composable Views:** Built with SwiftUI for a responsive and declarative UI.

### Key Components

#### 1. **Data Layer**
   - `ChapterListRepository`: Manages loading, caching, and organizing chapter data.
   - `ChapterDataStore Protocol`: Defines the interface for data fetching.
   - `ChapterLoaderAdapter`: Handles remote data loading and parsing using `SwiftSoup`.

#### 2. **UI Layer**
   - Built entirely with **SwiftUI**.
   - Includes reusable custom components like `DynamicSection` and `HapticButton`.

#### 3. **Persistence**
   - **SwiftData**: Used to persist chapters and maintain state across app sessions.
